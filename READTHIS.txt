Hello Instructors,

I wanted to provide additional context regarding why my project is not launching on Heroku. As mentioned in my previous Piazza posts (@335 and @338), the core functionality of my project relies on OpenCV for video manipulation and analysis. While this works correctly on my local machine, I encountered a critical issue when deploying to Heroku: the platform does not fully support the standard OpenCV library, only the smaller opencv-python-headless variant. Unfortunately, this variant lacks some of the functionalities I need for my projectâ€™s core features.

Despite spending several days researching and attempting to resolve this issue, I found no viable workaround to get the full OpenCV library running on Heroku. Numerous online discussions suggest that this has been a longstanding limitation with no clear solution.

I understand that you may need to grade the project as deployed on Heroku. If this limitation affects my score, I understand. However, I wanted to make you aware of the technical constraints I faced. Should you wish to test the program locally, please note that it only accepts videos under 60 seconds in length to ensure timely analysis.

Thank you for your understanding and for a wonderful semester. I hope you have a great break.

Best regards,
Jordan Espinal
